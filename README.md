# 🚀 Hyperparameter Optimization with Optuna  

Welcome to this repository! 🎯 This project explores **Optuna**, an advanced hyperparameter optimization framework, and demonstrates how it can outperform traditional techniques like **GridSearchCV** and **RandomSearchCV**.  

---

## 📌 What's Inside?  
- ✅ Introduction to Hyperparameter Tuning  
- ✅ Comparison of **GridSearchCV**, **RandomSearchCV**, and **Optuna**  
- ✅ Hands-on implementation using **RandomForest, XGBoost, and SVM**  
- ✅ **Define-by-Run**: Dynamically choosing models & hyperparameters  
- ✅ Optuna’s **Visualization Tools** 📊

🎯 Why Optuna?

⚠️ Problems with GridSearchCV:
Computationally Expensive: Evaluating all possible hyperparameter combinations takes a lot of time.
Doesn’t Scale Well: If you tune multiple hyperparameters, the number of combinations explodes!

🔥 How RandomSearchCV Helps?
Instead of searching every combination, it picks random sets of hyperparameters.
However, it may miss the best combination due to randomness.

🚀 Why Optuna is Better?
Efficient Search: Uses Bayesian Optimization (TPE Sampler) instead of brute force.
FOMO-Free: Finds optimal values intelligently without missing important regions.
Supports Define-by-Run: You can dynamically choose models and tune multiple hyperparameters at once!

🔥 Define-by-Run: The Game-Changer
Instead of just optimizing one model, Optuna allows dynamic search spaces where multiple classifiers can be tested at once!

For example, instead of tuning only RandomForest, we can search for the best model among:
✔️ RandomForest
✔️ XGBoost
✔️ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Optuna automatically selects the best model and tunes its hyperparameters! 🤯
